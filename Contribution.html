     <p><b>1.Hardy Ramanyjan Number</b> <p>   Once Hardy visited to Putney where Ramanujan was hospitalized. He visited there in a taxi cab having number 1729. Hardy was very superstitious due to his such nature when he entered into Ramanujan’s room, he 
quoted that he had just came in a taxi cab having number 1729 which seemed to him an unlucky number but at 
that time, he prayed that his perception may go wrong as hewanted that his friend would get well soon, but 
Ramanujan promptly replied that this was a very interesting number as it is the smallest number which can be 
expressed as the sum of cubes of two numbers in two different ways as given below:
1729=1<sup>3</sup>+12<sup></sup>=10<sup>3</sup>+9<sup>3</sup>

<p><b>2.Goldbach’s conjecture</b><p>Goldbach’s conjecture is one of the important illustrations of Ramanujan contribution towards the 
proof of the conjecture. The statement is every even integer > 2 is the sum of two primes, that is, 6=3+3. 
Ramanujan and his associates had shown that every large integer could be written as the sum of at most four 
(Example: 43=2+5+17+19)

<p><b>3.Theory Of Equation</b><p>Ramanujan was shown how to solve cubic equations in 1902 and he went on to find his own method to 
solve the quadratic. He derived the formula to solve biquadratic equations.The following year, he tried to 
provide the formula for solving quintic but he couldn’t as he was not aware of the fact that quintic could not be 
solved by radicals.
<p><b>4.Ramanujan-Hardy Asymtopic Formula</b><p>Ramanujan’s one of the major work was in the partition of numbers. By using partition function 𝑝(𝑛), he derived a number of formulae in order to calculate the partition of numbers. In a joint paper with Hardy, 
Ramanujan gave an asymptotic formulas for𝑝(𝑛).In fact, a careful analysis of the generating function for 𝑝 𝑛 
leads to the Hardy-Ramanujan asymptotic formula given by
 $$ p(n) \sim \dfrac{1}{4n\sqrt{3}}e^{T\sqrt{n/6}} $$

 <p><b>5.Ramanujan'Congruence</b><p>Ramanujan’s congruences are some remarkable congruences for the partition function. He discovered 
the congruences
<p>𝑝 (5𝑛 + 4) ≡ 0 (𝑚𝑜𝑑 5) 
<p>𝑝 (7𝑛 + 5) ≡ 0 (𝑚𝑜𝑑 7) 
<p>𝑝 (11𝑛 +6)≡ 0 (𝑚𝑜𝑑 11), ∀𝑛 ∈ 𝑁.
<p>In his 1919 paper, he gave proof for the first two congruencesusing the following identities using 
Pochhammer symbol notation. After the death of Ramanujan, in 1920, the proof of all above congruences 
extracted from his unpublished work.
<p><b>6.Some Other Contributions</b><p>
     Apart from the contributions mentioned above, he worked in some other areas of mathematics such as 
     hypogeometric series, Bernoulli numbers, Fermat’s last theorem. He focused mainly on developing the 
     relationship between partial sums and products of hyper-geometric series. He independently discovered 
     Bernoulli numbers and using these numbers, he formulated the value of Euler’s constant up to 15 decimal
     places. He nearly verified Fermat’s last theorem which states that no three natural number 𝑥, 𝑦 and 𝑧 satisfy the equation

$$ x^{n}+y^{n}=z^{n} $$ for any integer n>2.

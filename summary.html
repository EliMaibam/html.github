               <p><li><b>Ramanujan(1887-1920).</b>An intuitive mathematical genius, Ramanujan's discoveries have influenced several areas of mathematics, but he is probably most famous for his contributions to number theory and infinite series, among them fascinating formulas ( pdf ) that can be used to calculate digits of pi in unusual ways.</li>
                <p><li><b>Hardy-Ramanujan Number</b>- It's the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways." Because of this incident, 1729 is now known as the Ramanujan-Hardy number.</li></p>
                    <p><li><b> Goldbach's Conjecture</b>-Goldbach conjecture, in number theory, assertion (here stated in modern terms) that every even counting number greater than 2 is equal to the sum of two prime numbers. </li></p>
                    <p><li><b>Theory of Equation</b> In mathematics, in the field of number theory, the Ramanujan–Nagell equation is an equation between a square number and a number that is seven less than a power of two.</li></p>
                   <p> <li><b>Ramanujan-Hardy Asymptopic Formula</b>Ramanujan's approximate formula, developed in 1918, helped him spot that numbers ending in 4 or 9 have a partition number divisible by 5, and he found similar rules for partition numbers divisible by 7 and 11. Without offering a proof, he wrote that these numbers had “simple properties” possessed by no others.</li></p>
